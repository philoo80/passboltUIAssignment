						<p>
							Our long term vision is to play nice with others. We aim to provide integrations with other
							password managers, keyrings and user management services instead of trying to replace them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Obviously there is still a long way to go, but for now you can already build custom
							integrations by taking advantage of the JSON API.
						</p>
						<p>
							Did we mention we also provide a styleguide in case you want to customize passbolt look
							and feel?
